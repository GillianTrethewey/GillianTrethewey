### Hi there, I'm Gillian Trethewey</a> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">



### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a self-taught software engineer formally trained as a Civil engineer and teacher. I love programming, quilting, and my side gig is teaching police officers to pass their mathematics and language testing and interviews.

I've been coding on the web since 2014.  This has included making membership e-commerce websites for clients, creating and maintaining my own teaching website at https://cognitiveresults.com, as well as working for another developer doing CBT along with junior retainer work with clients. 

I'm levelling up my skills to include PHP, JS, React, and Python. I have completed a first year Computer Science course, along with a Java course at Athabasca University. I'm working through several courses daily to level up the rest of the skills. I may take a Bootcamp in the fall for 6 months.
