### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a software developer with university education and job experience as a Civil engineer and a mathematics specialist teacher. I have dual citizenship with both Canada and the UK. I love programming, creating, and I'm proficient at membership, e-commerce websites such as:  https://cognitiveresults.com - but that business runs itself. I'm concurrently working on Fullstack software engineering along with WordPress and Shopify for small business owners. I've been coding on the web since 2012.
