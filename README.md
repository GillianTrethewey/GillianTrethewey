### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a software engineer with university education and job experience as a Civil engineer and a mathematics specialist teacher. I have dual citizenship with both Canada and the UK.I love programming, creating, and I'm proficient at membership, e-commerce websites such as:  https://cognitiveresults.com - but that's not my focus - instead it's doing React/Expo/Go! I've been coding on the web since 2012.

** Snapshot: **
- 😄 March 8, 2022 Totally reorganized GitHub Repositories and started fresh.
- 😄 November goals: continue with React Native and Expo, TypeScript, and Go(lang).
- 😄 I code most days!
- 👨🏻‍💻 My stack: HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox and Grid, WordPress, Git, Python, JavaScript, React.js, Django, Node.js, React-Native, Expo, Golang, TypeScript.
- 👨🏻‍💻 More of my stack: Local, SASS, yarn, gulp, Heroku, Postgres, SQL, Seaborn, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Google Colab, Pandas, and Pygal.
- 😄 I use Local, Fetch, and Visual Studio on a Mac with two monitors. 
- 🔭 I've finished 400 Days of Code (100 Days of Code times 4). That means I've logged 400 days of code ... I've coded more, but logged that.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I used the Day of Code projects to log my progress and courses completed. There is no substitute for daily coding.
