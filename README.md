### Hi there, I'm Gillian Trethewey</a> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">



### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a self-taught software engineer formally trained as a Civil engineer and teacher. I'm currently working on my Masters of Data Science with Eastern U. Concurrently, I'm doing Kickstart Coding Bootcamp to get more complex projects into my portfolio, both Frontend and Backend. 

I love programming, creating, and I'm proficient at membership, e-commerce websites such as:  https://cognitiveresults.com

I've been coding on the web since 2014.  I work for another developer doing CBT along with retainer work with clients. 

I'm a loyal, steady, hard-worker with strong ethics. 
See my Django app that combines a GitHub API along with Postgresql DB to render a Resources section. Deployed on Heroku at https://gillian-trethewey-django-db.herokuapp.com/
