### Hi there, I'm Gillian Trethewey</a> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">



### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a self-taught software engineer formally trained as a Civil engineer and teacher. I'm currently working on my Masters of Data Science with Eastern U. Concurrently, I'm currently a Kickstart Coding Apprentice working on getting more complex projects into my portfolio, both Frontend and Backend. 

I love programming, creating, and I'm proficient at membership, e-commerce websites such as:  https://cognitiveresults.com

I've been coding on the web since 2012.  

I'm a loyal, steady, hard-worker with strong ethics. 
See my Django app that combines a GitHub API along with Postgresql DB to render a Resources section. Deployed on Heroku at https://gillian-trethewey-django-db.herokuapp.com/
