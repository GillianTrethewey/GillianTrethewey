### Hi there, I'm Gillian Trethewey</a> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">



### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am an engineer and teacher transitioning to Front End Web Development. I love programming, quilting, and teaching police officers to pass their testing and interviews.

I've been coding since 2014.  This has included making membership e-commerce websites for clients, creating and maintaining my own teaching website at https://cognitiveresults.com, as well as working for another developer doing CBT along with junior retainer work with clients. 

I'm levelling up my skills to include PHP and JS, React, and Python. I have completed a first year Computer Science course, along with a Java course at Athabasca University. I'm working through several courses daily to level up the rest of the skills. I may take a Bootcamp in the fall for 6 months.
