### Hi there, I'm Gillian Trethewey <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
#### I cleaned out my GitHub March 8, 2022 and started fresh! I push most days, but because I have nested repos (for organization), the green 'garden' looks more sparse than it is. ####

### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a software engineer with university education and job experience as a Civil engineer and a mathematics specialist teacher. I'm working on getting more complex projects into my portfolio, both Frontend and Backend. My goal is to be hired full-time, remote, for React or Expo/Go development. I have dual citizenship with both Canada and the UK.

I love programming, creating, and I'm proficient at membership, e-commerce websites such as:  https://cognitiveresults.com

I've been coding on the web since 2012.  

I'm a loyal, steady, hard-worker and am really nice to get along with! I've been told many times I'm a good communicator.
