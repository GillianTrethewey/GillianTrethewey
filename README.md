### Thanks for visiting! &nbsp; 

I am a software engineer with university education and job experience as a Civil engineer and a mathematics specialist teacher. I have dual citizenship with both Canada and the UK.I love programming, creating, and I'm proficient at membership, e-commerce websites such as:  https://cognitiveresults.com - but that's not my focus - instead it's full-stack engineering! I've been coding on the web since 2012.
